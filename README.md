## Creating a Discord Bot

As Discord does not allow you to use RPC if the bot is not owned by you, you need to create a application.

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on "New Application"
3. Name your application and click "Create"
4. Go to the "OAuth2" tab
5. Add a redirect URL to the "Redirects" section. This can be any URL, but it must be a valid URL. You can use for example `https://eniaclec.com`
6. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" from this page.
7. Open up FlexDesigner
8. Go to the "Settings" -> "Application" tab
9. Select "Discord" from the side menu
10. Paste the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" into the respective fields
11. Click "Save"
12. Click "Authenticate"
 
Yay! You have successfully created a Discord bot and authenticated it with FlexDesigner. You can now use the Discord Voice controls and soundboard features in FlexDesigner.
